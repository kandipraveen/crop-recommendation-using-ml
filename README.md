Crop Recommendation Using Random Forest Algorithm This project provides an intelligent crop recommendation system using the Random Forest algorithm. The system analyzes soil features, weather conditions, and other environmental factors to suggest the most suitable crop for a given location.Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
Description
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.

The system takes into account several factors such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a given region. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area.

Key Features
✅ Machine Learning Model: Uses the Random Forest algorithm for accurate crop prediction.
✅ Dataset: Trained on agricultural data containing soil properties, weather parameters, and crop yields.
✅ Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection for improved model performance.
✅ Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
✅ User Interface (Optional): A simple UI for users to input soil and weather parameters to get crop recommendations.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations. 
Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests. HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages used for designing the web interface. JavaScript: Scripting language used for client-side interactions and enhancing the user interface.

Installation and Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
